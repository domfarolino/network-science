# Assignment 11

NS11A.java implements Step 1 of the Louvain algorithm.  Add code to print out the communities
it finds in footballNeighbors.txt and compare the result with the NCAA 1990 conferences which
can be found in footballNet.txt in Assignment 4.  You may use the labels ArrayList to print
the names of the nodes.  Which nodes are "misclassified"?

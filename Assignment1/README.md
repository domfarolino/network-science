stringentNet.txt is a protein-protein interaction network in the neighbors form.

Use NS2A on it to generate the degree counts.

Save the output and use Excel to generate a scatter plot.

Fit a power “trending” to the degree distribution and record the power law (the mathematical equation of the fit).

Change the axes to logarithmic scale and generate a log-log plot and the power curve should become a straight line.

Submit the two plots with the trending line and equation.

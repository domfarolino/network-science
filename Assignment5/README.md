# Assignment 5

IR6A.java takes the number of nodes and the degree exponent as command line arguments, generates
a degree sequence via the cumulative distribution function, and uses the configuration model to generate
a random power-law network with the given parameters.  Add code to report the percentage of links that are
multi-links and self-loops.  Run your program with N = 10^3, 10^4, and 10^5 and gamma = 2.2 and 3 and show
the outcomes.  (Barabasi Homework 4.3).

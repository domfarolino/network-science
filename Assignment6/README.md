# Assignment 6

Use NS7A.java on graph5c.g6 (or graph8c.g6 and graph9c.g6) to generate a scatter
chart from the (Hamming distance between edges, Euclidean distance between laplacian
eigenvalues) pairs for each pair of connected graphs of the given node number.  Notice
that Hamming distance between adjacency matrices is only an upper bound to the graph distance,
which is the minimum Hamming distance after all permutation of vertices.

Can eigenvalues be used as a representation of the network so that when networks are similar,
their eigenvalues (and presumably, the Fiedler vectors) are also similar (based on some
similarity measure)?

Submit your addition to the program, the visualization for comparing representations, and your
answer to the question above.

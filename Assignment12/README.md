# Assignment 12

NS13A.java enumerates all maximal cliques in a network.

NS13B.java builds a clique graph and finds components in
it and translates them into clique percolation sets in the
original network.

Write a function or program to compute clique size distribution
of a network.  Report the distributions of a random network, the
football network, and stringentNet.
